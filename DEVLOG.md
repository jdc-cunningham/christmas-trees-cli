These are the immediate concerns
- printing colored pipe
- get two basic servers running on each phone
  though only use PPP to PP to start the tree
- make the tree show up, randomize the colors

yooo it works... nice

what do I need, red, green, grey, oh and pulsing top pipe for extra points

asterisk would probably look prettier but I got the idea from htop

Can see what I'm going for

My other big concern is printing it/animating it where it stays in the same place

it's done, took longer than I would have liked

minor errors here and there, mostly stuff like copying into nano for some reason breaks the code due to line breaks
